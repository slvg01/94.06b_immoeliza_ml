## Project context

The objective is to determine the best possible machine learning model to predict property price on the belgium market. The initial data set is coming from  an initial immoweb scraping,  analysis and cleaning (see (repository)[https://github.com/slvg01/immo-eliza-scraping-Qbicle.git])

## Data
The Input data set has 75K properties over 28 features, beyond the target variable which is the price 
The Data have been initially preprocessed in order to : 
- remove the outliers. Seeing the nb of outliers a conservative approach has been used to avoid too much data exclusion  wit a +-3.5 IQR usage which induced a loss of 10% of the data.
- standardize the numerical data using standardscaler
Nevertheless test on the final chosen model shown that score were higher without it. Those steps were thus taken out.

Final model that was retained and that is embedded in the last version of the script is GradientBoostingRegressor

## Performance
Performance metrics has been exclusively coefficent of determination (r2) during the training and testing phase  and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with the real world data test

## Limitations
For the 2 last model used here are some limitations to take into account :  

gradientboosting model : 
- can be sensitive to outliers whereas in that case outliers were finally not taken appart because of better score on test set
- it can be computationnally expensive on big set (not so much the case here) because of the weak learners addition

RandomForest is 
- computationnally expensive as each trees is trained independantly. Thus larger max-depth like the one used here is expensive
- lack of interpreatbility : understanding the main contributing features to the prediction is not a given, :  to the 
- overfitting and sensibility to noise are always a risk in the depth is too big. 
- last the imbalanced data risk is requesting  resampling to avoid that overprevalent feature takes too high domination in the prediction. To be reviewed on that point. 

## Usage
train.py is the script to train the model 
predict.py is the script to generate prediction. As specified at the end of that script it can be used directly through commandline.

- cd in 6b-immoeliza_ml
- run requirement.txt
- run train.py and predict.py as you need
